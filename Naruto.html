                <p>Naruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Naruto) (/ˈnɑːrutoʊ/) is the titular protagonist
                    of
                    the manga Naruto, created by Masashi Kishimoto. He is a ninja from the fictional Hidden Leaf Village
                    (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れ, Hepburn: konohagakure). As a boy, Naruto is ridiculed and ostracized on account of
                    the
                    Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed away in his
                    body.
                    Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage, in order to receive their
                    approval.

                    to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara, but the
                    events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an
                    ideal world.</p>
